I make them from wood. Wax and steel and putty and clay 
are also dandy. If you've got a broken gewgaw, glue it together and use it -- 
cast a new one! They shouldn't be too complex, in terms of undercut bits. That 
requires investment/lost wax casting. Avoid straight edges -- use taper edges. 
For instance, I just cast an odd-form chuck for my lathe, which looks like a big
huge cup; I put pieces to machine inside the cup and bolts through the side of
the cup hold the pieces in place.  When I made the form, instead of casting it as a 
perfect cylinder, I made the wooden form with a slight taper, like the very base 
of a cone with the top cut off. If the sides are strictly cylindrical, when you
go to remove it from the sand, you will end up pulling sand out with the form.  
You want forms tapered like Dixie cups, not beer cans.<p>
I use solid wood rather than plywood. The end-grain is much better for 
surface quality. This is a trade-off; solid wood forms also will tend to warp
over time.  But I rarely reuse my forms; I cast once and if I need another copy
the next time around I use the casting rather than the wooden form.<p>
What works for me is to dip all the forms in hot wax, to reduce 
surface imperfections. This has the added effect of dealing with the casting 
equivalent of Xerox burn. When you make a mold you add excess material for 
machining tolerance, and excess material for shrinkage. Once you've cast 
something and cut the sprue off, you can use it as a form. It has shrunk, 
already, so if you want to make the next one larger, to prepare for its 
shrinkage allowance, you can dip it in wax and fill in any pits.<p>
Drip a very small amount of water around the edges of the 
wooden form before removing it from the sand -- this strengthens the sand.
You can also blow out bits of sand that have fallen loose into the form void.<p> 
It will also help to provide a fairly thick sprue that connects to the side of 
the form, which somewhat prevents the aluminum messing up the void during 
pouring, by lifting/eroding sand from the face of the image itself. To get the 
air to smoothly leave the void when the aluminum is flowing in, it can help to 
use a long thin straight wire to poke holes into the sand, from the form out
through the top.  A good cast will have aluminum run out these little air
holes.<p>
Sprues and risers: Make them huge. I use 2"x2" sections that I've put a slight 
taper on with a radial arm saw. (This also works really well as a ramming-up 
tool.) In the sprueing, the height of the sprue top, compared to the top of the 
form, determines to a large extent the solidity of the casting. The more 
hydrostatic pressure you can generate in the sprue, the better the detail and 
solidity of the final casting. So one thing you can do is to use a sprue 
extender. I use a 6-oz steel tomato can with both ends cut out, that I place 
over/around the sprue hole just before I pour. It's nice to have tall enough 
risers, such that when you pour, the aluminum can come out of the risers. This 
floats some of the slag and dross out the top.  The risers also vastly increase
the quality of the casting; when the casting is solidifying it contracts at
the top, and if you have a big riser off the top of your form, the contraction
will all happen in the riser, which you then cut off, rather than in the top
part of your form.<p> 
I'll mention this over on the casting forms page as well, but it is very important
that you make casting boxes which positively attach to one another -- ie they can
be pinned or hooked together.  Aluminum is very heavy stuff.  Just because the 
mold frame weighs a hunnert zillion pounds, means nothing when you pour the hot metal
in; it *will* float the top frame full of sand right off the lower one and spill
metal ALL OVER the floor and your shoes and everything else in sight, and you will
not get a good casting.  One of my recent castings, I was casting shot for a coilgun.
The pieces were 3" outer diameter, 2.5" inner diameter, maybe 3/4" high, weighed a
couple ounces each.  I thought, "Hey, no problem, I don't have to worry about doing
a full mold" and did only the upper part of the mold, which I set on a 2x2" frame
that I'd packed full of sand for a nice flat surface.  I poured, and even this little
bit of aluminum floated a half a cubic foot of water-filled sand right on up and let
aluminum come pouring out the sides of the frame.  The casting turned out good, as it
happens, but that's amazing -- and I had a sheet of 1/2" thick aluminum that connected
all the individual rings (I cast six at a time) to each other like a huge web, and it
was very difficult to break them out of this web.  Don't cast without pinning your
frames together.  It won't work.  Trust me on this one.  Or try it out yourself
and see.  Just wear heavy leather boots.<p>
