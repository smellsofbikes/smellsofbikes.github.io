<body><h3>Manufacture of Chainmail (fer fun & profit.)</h3><p>

Warning: this was written for alpha only, and some bits don't   
translate well to The Net.  I will try and get it rewritten, with maybe   
some graphics added in, someday.<hr><p>



Materials:<p><ul>

<li>1/4 to 1/2 mile of 14 gauge electric fence or mild steel wire.

<li>3/8" x 3' steel rod.  (hardware stores have this.)

<li>1/8" drill bit.

<li>Diagonal clippers that can handle 14 gauge wire.

<li>Either: reversible electric drill, 3/8" chuck, with 1/4 hp or more

<li>Or:	vice, 3" jaw, STURDY mountings, and 2 standard bicycle wheel   
cartridge bearings, 3/8" ID x 1" OD	(these can be used/thrashed,   
found at bike stores.)

<li>Either:	hacksaw, 12" by 18-24 teeth per inch, and vice, 3" jaw,   
VERY STURDY moutings,

<li>Or:	HEAVY duty clippers/small bolt cutters.  (these need to be   
able to stand up to a LOT of use.)</ul><p>



I personally recommend that you get the drill, the vise, and the   
hacksaw.  Minimize effort.  If you want a good product, use good tools.    
Drills, hacksaws, and vises are all useful for a LOT more than just this   
-- they're like can-openers.  A thousand household uses.<p>



If no drill: Wind springs on 3/8 rod.  This is done by drilling (with   
a borrowed drill, or drill press in a student shop somewhere) a 1/8"   
hole through the rod, about 1 foot from the end of the rod.  This hole   
easily holds 14-gauge wire, when winding.  To get the torque to wind the   
wire, put two bends in the short (1') section of the rod, to approximate   
a handle shape, and put the bearings on the rod to support it.  Keep   
them in place by wrapping masking tape around the rod.  Clamp the   
bearings in the vise and wind using the handle.  <img 
src="images/mandrel.gif" align = "right" vspace = 10 hspace = 10>   (Ersatz bearings can be made by drilling a 
3/8" hole in a piece of wood   and clamping that in the vise or bolting 
it to something if you don't   have a vise.  This sucks but it works.)  
<p>

If you have a drill: drill a 1/8" hole in the 3/8" rod, about 2" from   
one end.  Chuck the rod in the drill and wind using the drill motor.    
(Don't overheat the drill.  Be especially careful if it has less than   
1/2 horsepower.)  <p>

If you have a drill and a vise (optimal): drill a 1/8" hole in the   
3/8" rod about 6" from the end.  Either clamp the drill in the vise (be   
careful) or put two bearings (3/8" x 1") on the rod immediately in front   
of the drill and clamp those in the vise.  The latter method is much   
nicer to the bearing surfaces in the drill. <p>

Warnings: ALWAYS wear leather gloves when winding and cutting wire.    
You could easily get a finger amputated by getting it caught in the wire   
while winding.  Always wind the wire in the same direction.  You will go   
absolutely crackers if you've got different windings mixed.  Trust me on   
these.<p>



Springs to rings:<p>

If you have a vise: clamp spring horizontally in the vise, and saw   
down the side of the spring, perpendicular to the tangent.  With a bit   
(well, a LOT) of practise, this produces beautiful, O-shaped rings with   
only a little gap to be closed up later.  The cut should be as   
perpendicular to the wire as manangeable.<p>

Saw with moderate pressure on the cutting stroke and almost no   
pressure on the return stroke.  Wax the blade occasionally to prevent   
overheating.  Use Lenox blades -- they last forever.  I recommend using   
safe-jaws, pieces of bent sheet steel or aluminum, to cover the vise jaw   
faces, to guard against the inevitable slips.  Tape a box to the vise   
below the cutting point to catch rings as they fall.<p>

Without vise: clip rings off spring with clippers or bolt cutters.    
Wear a glove to prevent blisters on your hand.  <p>



Now, you have a box of rings.  You need: about 10,000 rings for a   
typical shirt, which is roughly 60 feet of spring, or about 990 feet of   
wire.  This weighs about 20 lbs.  A coif is about 5000 rings, chausses   
(pants) are about 7500 rings.<p>



There are places which sell rings in bulk, but it's not cheap.  
<a href="http://www.chainmail.com/">Chainmail.com</a> seems to have
better prices than most.  Stainless steel wire looks nice, but if you ever really work your   
chainmail out, you'll find that stainless steel rings tend to shatter   
under weapon impact, where mild steel rings bend and absorb the blow.    
Bending and cutting the stainless steel is also a pain.  Copper,   
aluminum, and bronze also work well, but are usually a bit soft, and   
tend to open spontaneously.  They can be soldered, brazed, welded, or   
riveted, to ameliorate this problem, but those are subjects beyond the   
scope of this discussion.<p>



Manufacture of mail from rings:<p>

This is a very difficult thing to explain without the use of either   
live aids or pictures.  (Some pictures added recently.)  I am going to   
describe the manufacture of butted 4/1 mail, in which each ring connects   
with four others.  This is practically the only pattern that was ever   
used in Europe.  Asian mail had a LOT more variety than this, but that's   
a subject unto itself.<p>

Materials required:<p><ul>

	<li>Patience.  Get lots of this.

	<li>Either:Two pairs of pliers, with wide (3/8"+) jaws,

	<li>Or:One pair of pliers, as above, and one crescent wrench, 6" -   
8"</ul><p>

I prefer the latter.  Everyone else in the universe prefers the   
former. <p>

The process:<p>

The primary thing to keep in mind at all times, when learning to make   
mail, is that each ring intersects four other rings, except for at the   
very edges.  Chainmail has a definite warp and woof -- an x/y asymmetry   
in stretcheability.  Look in a good dictionary and see if you can find a   
picture and xerox it -- that will help immensely.<p>

There are two different types of rings in chainmail, ones that slant   
to the right, because they are held that way by their neighbors, who all   
slant to the left, and the left-slanters, who are held by the right-  
slanters.  When you look at the edge of a piece of mail, it makes a zig-  
zag pattern of intersecting rings.<p><img src = "images/zigzag.gif" align = left> 

While you're pondering on that, grab some rings.  Link them together   
to form a long chain, and close the links.  If they're cut right, you   
should be able to slip them together without using the pliers, and then   
close them afterwards.  Keep the Henry Ford principle in mind here: do   
one thing lots of times and then shift to doing another thing.  It's   
more efficient.  I make 30 five-foot long sections of linked chain in   
one session and then close all the rings in all the sections the next   
night.  But for the nonce, make two chains that are each 21 rings long.    
(there's a reason for this unusual number, that I'll explain later.)    
The process of closing rings is tricky -- instead of crushing them   
together, you grab the ring with the pliers on one side of the gap, grab   
them on the other side with the other pair of pliers (or crescent   
wrench) and combine a bit of inward pressure with twisting.  I usually   
twist the ring from its inital open state, PAST the closed state, into   
the open state on the other side, and then finesse it back closed, to   
get the nicest-looking closure.  Getting this so that the gap is   
minimised and the ring is flat instead of potato-chip-shaped is a matter   
of practise.<p>

Now, the first critical step: lay one chain down so that it is flat.    
When I say flat, I mean that every other link slants in the same   
direction; the links alternate tilting directions.  The links at each   
end of the chain should be tilting in the same direction, because the   
chain is an odd number of links long.  If you look at this chain end-on,   
it should make an X shape.  It takes a bit of time getting used to   
laying chain out this way; rotate the end as you lay it out, if   
necessary, to get it to lay flat.<p>

Here is <a href="images/startmail.jpg"> a picture of two lines of mail lying flat </a> in big picture form.  <p>
Second critical step: Lay down the other chain so that it's identical   
to the first one.  The terminal rings should tilt in the same direction   
as those of the first chain.  Carefully scoot the two chains together so   
that they overlay each other slightly, making sure that none of the   
rings flip as you move them.<p> <img src = "images/two.gif"> <p>
Here is <a href="images/midmail.jpg"> a picture of two lines of mail all snuggled together </a> in big picture form.  <p>

Third critical step, and by far the ugliest step of them all:  Link   
the two chains together.  Open a free link to about three wire   
diameters, (that's about 1/4"), to form a helical segment, and, using a   
corkscrew movement, wind this open link through four links of the   
chains.  I'll try to describe this more.  You want to connect four   
links, two from each chain.  These are NOT adjacent links.  You are   
connecting alternating rings -- rings that all slope in the same   
direction.  So, if we number the rings in our chains from 1 - 21, from   
left to right, and we have chains U and L, like so:<p>  

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9...21<p>

U: O C O C O C O C O  (I am notating the rings so that O rings<p> 

L: O C O C O C O C O   slant one direction, C rings another.)<p>



I am assuming that you have the chains set out so that the ring U1 (an   
"O") has its lower edge on top of the upper edge of L1.  If this is not   
true, ie if L1 is above U1, rotate the whole works (the table or book or   
whatever) 180 degrees so that U1 is over L1.  (This inverts the order of   
the numbering, of course, since you're now assigning the moniker L1 to   
what was U21.)<p>  

What we are attempting to do is connect, in order, rings U1, L1, L3,   
and finally, U3.  U2 and L2 should NOT be intersected or included.<p> <img   
src = "images/finallink.gif"><p> 
Here is <a href="images/endmail.jpg"> a picture of a single ring just put in place </a> in big picture format.  <p>
Then, after closing this (and totally 
messing up   the entire pattern, no doubt) we will reflatten the chains 
and connect U3, L3, L5, and U5, in that order, with the next ring, and 
then U5, L5, L7, U7, etc.  This order of ring-linking is quite 
important.  Then just continue doing this, adding one chain at a time, 
until you either finish or go mad.<p>

It helps, when you've become proficient at this, to lay all the   
helical connecting links in place, and carefully lift the entire row by   
the helical link on one end, under tension, and then close them all, one   
by one.  Again, the Henry Ford Principle: screw for a while, then close   
them all, in batches.<p>

If you cannot get this to work no matter how hard you try, I offer an   
alternate technique that doesn't work for me but does for other people:   
make your initial lengths of chain, alternating one ring and then two   
rings and then one, etc.  I represent this as o=o=o=o=o=o=o where the o   
is one ring and the = two rings.  Then try the same process as listed   
earlier, laying them flat-wise so that they alternate slant directions.    
(ie all single rings tilt up towards the top and all double rings tilt   
up towards the bottom.)  Then try to interconnect just the double rings   
with another identical chain, in the same manner listed, ie U1, L1, L3,   
U3.  (this is assuming your chain ends in a double-ring.  Don't bother   
trying to interconnect single rings.  They're already connected to four   
rings so they're no longer of interest.  Only try to play with rings   
that have space available.)<p>



Confused?  Like I said, this is not an easy matter to teach in a   
hands-on manner, much less a purely alpha graphics medium.  The process   
involves stacking one chain on the end of the growing block and adding   
it on each time.  As you'll soon notice, this involves alternating the   
pattern of adding corkscrew rings, as you'll add (if you're doing the   
single chain addition technique using chains 21 long) ten rings to one   
run, then 11 to the next, then 10 again.  With a bit of practise, you   
can load all 10 (or 11) corkscrew rings in at once, and then CAREFULLY   
pick the line up and close them all in one pass, which speeds things up   
TREMENDOUSLY.  But you invariably end up dropping the line on the floor,   
or having a bunch of rings fall out of their places so that they're only   
encircling three rings instead of four, when you start this, so it gets   
annoying.<p>

Why 21 rings long? I hear the question resounding from the furtherest   
corners of the Earth.  Well, you remember my claim that there are two   
types of rings, leftists and rightists.  When you're making mail (we're   
voyaging into motivational techniques here) you are going to get VERY   
depressed, at about the time you've got two square feet of mail and are   
adding these diminuitive quantities of rings on.  The project ahead   
seems overwhelming; there is no sense of progress.  So what I recommend   
is that you sit down with groups of 210 rings each.  Well, don't bother   
counting, just grab a big thirty-foot-long length of chain, and from it,   
cut seven 21-link-long chains.  Adding corkscrew rings, turn this into a   
nifty little block of mail, measuring 10 rings along the edge and 21   
along the length, which is 210 rings.  The astute among you might have   
noticed that the number of corkscrew rings is 1/3 the number of rings   
contained in the chains of 21 -- which is unsurprising.  Anyway, when   
you've made about forty of these little chunks, you can sit down and   
assemble them into a shirt, and it's nice to just watch this pile of   
chunks grow.  Stack these squares on the floor.  Pile them in   
interesting formations.  It gives one a sense of accomplishment lacking   
from adding one ring onto this huge piece of mail, then adding another   
one, etc.  It is also a LOT easier to carry these little pieces   
around.<p>

Back to the 21 question: well, if we made each of these chunks 20   
rings long, so that they would each contain 200 links, we would end up   
with two varieties of blocks, randomly determined by how we add   
corkscrews.  One would have rightist links along both ends, and the   
other leftists.  By ends, I mean the termini of the chain segments   
you've linked.  The rightist blocks and the leftists are distinct, and a   
pain to connect to each other.  If you don't believe me on this, play   
around with making some patches that are only, say, six or eight   
chainlinks long, and see what I mean.  An odd length guarantees that,   
from some combination of rotations around either the x or z axis, the   
chunk will match edges with any other chunk.  (For any chemists out   
there, I *THINK* that an even-width, odd-length chunk of mail has a C1v   
point group, while an even-width, even-length chunk has a C2 group,   
implying that the latter is chiral (which is the entire point (pardon   
the pun) of this discussion, while the former, odd-length, is   
achiral.))<p>  

Fitting/design:<p>

This is a very subjective and experimental area of mail.  I personally   
have a 40" chest, so use ten panels of the above-mentioned patches for   
the body tube, which I make three panels long, or 30 panels in toto.    
The circumfrence is 105 rings.  (10 x 10 + 5 rings used in stitching   
them together, because only every other ring counts, since half of them   
aren't added onto the top row but onto the second.  Count it out, it'll   
make more sense.)  Now, to make the straps that will convert this tube   
into a vest, I use these same patches of 210.  I propose, for the   
purposes of this discussion, to use four whole patches, and use two   
patches made from bisecting edgewise one normal patch into two pieces,   
each of which are 10 rings on edge, 5 rings along the side.  I connect   
all this together to form two strips, each 27 rings long and 10 rings   
wide.  (why 27?  Because we added two rows worth of helices, when we   
connected the three patches.)<p>

Now, with a bit of math, (ie 4 strap attachments x 10 rings   
width/strap = 40, 105 - 40 = 65, and since I'd like the space between   
the attachments to be equal, coz it seems to fit well, 65 / 4 = 16 (drop   
the fraction) so I'll attach one strap at one end, completely, and count   
16 rings, and attach another strap, etc.  This will take some adjustment   
and fiddling; error towards extra space in the armpits and front   
spaces.) With this, I will have a vest.  You'll get the hang of it.    
Then, make some stuff with diagonal edges to serve as the front   
neckline, and fill the back neckline hole, between the straps, up very   
near to the top.  This involves just puttering about, and seeing what   
you can fit that still looks nice, and (IMPORTANT) fits over your   
head.<p>

Sleeves are most easily made by continuing the material from the tops   
of the vest straps right down to about the elbow, and continuing them   
around to meet and close on the other side.  However, this will leave a   
very nasty bit around the armpit, which doesn't connect at all well.    
Indeed, armpits have always been the downfall of mail, and doing a   
sophisticated armpit is quite difficult.  I say, leave them open for   
your first suit.  Just throw it together and enjoy it as it is.<p>

The original ones just ran them together, perpendicularly, extending   
the material from the chest up past the armpit and then jamming them   
together just under the biceps.  I personally put the ugly seam line in   
the armpit, against the pectoral muscle, because I think that helps the   
flexibility beneath the armpit, which is critical for comfortable fit   
and maneuverability.  It isn't easy to make these work out such that you   
can put your elbows against your sides.<p>

There are advanced topics, that involve gusseting and fitting in   
greater detail.  These involve alternating series of rings that only   
intersect three others, and rings that intersect five others, which, in   
groups, act to expand or contract chainmail.  The process of making   
these is that of making diagonal pieces and attaching them along the   
sides to normal pieces of mail, and is insanely complicated and mind-  
warping, so I am going to leave that for later.  Ditto on riveting   
processes, and armpit work.  I do include a <a href="helmpatt.html">  
helm  pattern </a> for chainmail layout, which is unusual in that it  
relies  only on nice, diagonal patches rather than the sort of chaotic  
gusseting  seen in more typical single-ring, diverging patterns.  This  
serves as an  introduction to gussets, which work excellently for  
following  contours.<p>

On the care and feeding of mail:<p>

If you use galvanized steel, as in electric fence wire, it should not   
ever have a problem with rusting.  If it does tend to rust, for lack of   
a coating, there's not a lot that is highly effective, that I know of.    
Coating it with heated wax works ok, although it tends to be messy on   
the padded shirt beneath it, and dipping it in lacquer works moderately   
well, but leaves a mottled appearance to individual rings, as a result   
of lacquer build-up at the contact points between rings.<p>
