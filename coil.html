Here are two Bryce pictures of my coilgun and switching mechanism.   I haven't 
gotten around to buying a digital camera so this will have to do for right now.
The gun plugs into the wall; one wire from the wall cord goes directly to the 
coil around the gun base and the other goes to one of the two terminals of the
switch.  The other end of the coil is connected to the other switch terminal.  Step 
on the switch, briefly, and the projectile goes flying off.  <p>
For making the switch, I have two pieces of wood, hinged, with 1/4" carriage bolts 
going through both pieces of wood so that when the hinge
closes, the carriage bolts touch.  Around the bolts, I used an exhaust valve 
spring from a car engine, to force the bolts apart when I stop pushing on the
switch.  This prevents them welding together.  I actually have the bolt heads 
inside the spring so that it's impossible to get a finger in where the exciting
stuff goes on.<p>

I made my projectile out of aluminum.  You could easily use a cut-off piece of 
pipe.  Copper and aluminum will work best but iron and steel will work fine.  It 
is necessary to have a continuous piece of metal for the projectile; that's a fundamental
part of how it works.  A piece of steel bent into a tube won't work; it'll just sit 
there when you close the switch.  If you solder it together, it will work, but not 
as well as a piece of tubing.<p>
The aluminum ring is cast and bored to correct internal diameter for sliding smoothly 
along the cardboard tube.  Of course, this will eventually wear the
cardboard out.  I'd like to fill the tube with epoxy then sand off the cardboard, 
leaving me with just the smooth epoxy for the ring to slide against.<p>
The tube is filled with very thin welding rod (for use in gas welding) because it's 
magnetically permeable and has less eddy current issues than a solid
iron core -- much as transformer cores are made of laminated sheets rather than a 
solid chunk of iron.<p>
The support system is basically a box with two holes in it where the coilgun tube 
fits.  It is assembled using pegs and glue; you should avoid using metal
in the construction of this.  The magnetic fields will induce currents in
metal fasteners and heat them up.  People melt stuff this way, industrially.<p>
How It Works: (an explanation based on what I've been told by Brian Jones (see
below) although the reasoning is his and the mistakes in trying to present
it are mine.)  When you close the switch, current flows through the coil,
which creates a large magnetic field -- an electromagnet.  This is somewhat
like a magnetic pump; the magnetic field shoots through the center of the 
coil, then spreads and returns around the outside of the coil.  The magnetic
field lines would look like lots of "D" shapes, with the straight part of
the "D" going through the center of the coil.<p>
The core of the coil is packed with wires, which are essentially conductors
of magnetism -- they have good magnetic permeability -- so the magnetic field
runs up them preferentially to moving through air, until it gets to the end
of a wire, where it bends outwards, the curved part of the "D", and returns
to the bottom of the coil.<p>
It is this point, where it bends outwards, (the top and bottom of the "D")
which gives thrust to the coilgun
projectile.  The horizontal component of the field is what is responsible for
the force that the projectile feels.  So, in order to get a good accelleration
along the body of the coilgun, what you want is a set of rods which end at
points all along the gun's barrel, giving you a continuous set of outwards-bending
magnetic fields.<p>

The positioning of the coil with respect to the core has a lot to do with the efficiency 
of the gun, as does the lengths of the wires packed in the core.  The
taper -- the decreasing number of core wires as you progress towards the top of the 
gun -- is supposed to be a major determinant of how much energy
you can get into the projectile.  I haven't had much of a chance to play with this; 
I was just pleased to get it working.<p>
The momentary contact draws a lot of current from the wall, but so quickly the breaker 
rarely trips.  Repeated firing doesn't seem to heat the projectile
that much, probably because of its cross-section, although the coil, which is made of 20 
ga magnet wire, does heat up quite a bit.  I wound the coil on
a piece of steel pipe that I'd cut up so that after winding I could pull the mandrel out 
in pieces from the coil.  My first version, I just wound it around a
steel pipe and could not slide the coil off the mandrel no matter what I tried.  The 
break-away mandrel was much more successful.<p>
The design was inspired by and created with suggestions from Brian Jones of the 
<a href="http://littleshop.physics.colostate.edu">Little Shop Of Physics</a>
project at Colorado State University.  They've made many, many, many other
creative physics demonstrations that are educational, fun, and often built of zero-tech or 
found materials.<p>
