  Home casting/foundry work notes.<br>
  I got started casting based on <a href="https://gingerybookstore.com/charcoalfoundry.html">David Gingery's charcoal foundry book</a>  This was a good place to start.<br>
  What I found:<br><ul>
  <li>Coal is hard to find.</li><br>
  <li>Charcoal burns out fast.</li><br>
  <li>It's hard to light and hard to refuel.</li></ul><br>
  So I moved to a <a href="http://www.myheap.com/casting-molding/my-heap-mold-book/chapter-2-tools/a-reil-type-propane-burner.html">Reil burner</a> fueled with propane.  This has been a lot more reliable.<br>
  I made my foundry the way Gingery suggested, mixing fire clay, water, and broken up bricks.  This worked okay.  It's very heavy and takes quite a while to heat up.<br>
  If I were to do it again I think I might use ceramic fiber blanket material, because it has far lower thermal mass.<br>
  If you have the money, there are modern castable refractory cements made for replacing the lining on fireplaces.  These do an amazing job of providing a durable refractory and take a fraction of the time to prepare and cure that the fire clay/brick designs take.<br>
  My first crucible was made of steel pipe with a steel plate welded on the bottom, both about 4mm thick.  That works okay.  You want to be very careful about the welds.  Hot aluminum leaks through cracks faster than water through a radiator crack.
