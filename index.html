<html><title>Testing</title>
<body>This is an index to some of the physical stuff I work on.  It's ported over from a site I made on my Amiga between about 1996 and 2010 and then left untouched until the ISP that hosted it stopped offering hosting services in early 2022.  So now it's all here.
  <p>
    I'm moving it over in small chunks and for a while there will be a lot of broken links and missing pictures, as all I managed to save was the text.<p>
