    To be honest, I don't know what to do about a sudden Spitfire either, but when I come up with some good ideas I'll put them here.<p>
    I do have a youtube video about replacing the transverse leaf spring on a later swing-spring Spitfire, because the (otherwise excellent) distributor how-to videos are all missing the critical part
    in which you disassemble the spring to get the swing pivot through the spring.  It really does not work without this.  You can't even assemble it.  So I feel like it's misleading of them to not include it.<p>
